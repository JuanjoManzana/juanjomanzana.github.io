      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The App is designed to help you discover and play publicly available TV streams. We do not require you to create an account and we do not directly collect personal information like your name or email inside the App.</p>

      <h3>Information We May Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage & diagnostics:</strong> crash reports, performance metrics, device model, OS version, and generic settings used solely to improve stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising identifiers:</strong> if ads are shown, third-party ad partners may access your device’s advertising ID to provide and measure ads. You can reset/limit this in your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Network requests:</strong> to load channel lists, logos, and streams your device contacts our or third-party servers. Server logs may include IP address and timestamps, retained for a limited period for security and operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>The App may integrate third-party SDKs or services (e.g., advertising, analytics, crash reporting, stream hosting). These parties act as independent controllers or processors of data under their own policies. Examples include (not exhaustive):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob)</li>
        <li>Crash reporting/analytics (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
        <li>Content/CDN providers that host logos or streams</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please refer to the respective provider’s privacy documentation for details on what they collect and why.</p>

      <h3>Cookies & Similar Technologies</h3>
      <p>The App itself does not set browser cookies. Third-party content or web pages opened from the App may use cookies or similar technologies.</p>

      <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h3>International Transfers</h3>
      <p>Depending on where you are, your data may be processed on servers located in other countries that may have different data protection laws.</p>

      <h3>Your Rights (UK/EEA)</h3>
      <p>If you are in the UK/EEA, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, and data portability, where applicable. You can exercise these by contacting us.</p>

      <h3>Data Retention</h3>
      <p>We keep diagnostic logs only as long as needed for troubleshooting and to meet legal or security obligations, after which they are deleted or anonymized.</p>
